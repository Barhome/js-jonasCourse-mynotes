# Section no.5 Address: Developer Skills & Editor Setup

..............

## Lecture no.55 Address: Setting up Prettier and VS Code

### Type: Code

- check notes about the course and the video in the website

## Lecture no.56 Address: Installing Node.js and Setting up a Dev Environment

### Type: Code

- check notes about the course and the video in the website

## Lecture no.57 Address: Learning How to Code

### Type: Theory

- Theory pdf pages 48-54 whenever you feel frustrated see this lecture.
- set a specific , measureable, realistic and time-based goal and write it down
- develop a plan on how to get your goal
- search the technologies you want to learn them one by one step by step.
- understand code and type it in your editor
- reinfore what was learned by using it immediately
- take notes
- challenge your self by small code exercise Codewars
- come up with projects and try to work on them to grow and over come obstacles
- leave tutorial hell and learn on your own
- don't get stuck with clean code , always refactor it, efficient code comes later after practice
- accept the fact that you will never know everything. like the legendary Kyle Simpson
- learn with other people , explain new concepts to other people, share goals to make yourself accountable and share learning progress with the web dev community #100DaysOfCode #CodeNewbie, #webdev etc.
- keep on working on projects
- last slide is important.

## Lecture no.58 Address: How to Think like a Developer Become a Problem Solver!

### Type: Theory

- Theory pdf pages 54-61
- make a plan and follow a logical approach.
- steps to follow:
  1. make sure you understand the problem by asking the right questions to get a clear picture of the problem
  2. divide and conquer by breaking a proble into smaller sub problems
  3. try your coding skills if fail search for a solution on google
  4. write a pseudo code before writing the actual code it is the code that is easily understood by human to help you write the actual code. It looks like a real code as we use similar structure of a programming language
- develop a genuine curiosity and passion for understanding how things actually work, not only in programming but really in the whole world around you.

## Lecture no.59 Address: Using Google, StackOverFlow and MDN

### Type: Code

- watch the video if you need a refresher

## Lecture no.60 Address: Debugging(Fixing Errors)

### Type: Theory

- Theory pdf pages 62-65
- what is a software bug? a defact or a problem in a computer program that causes unintended or unexpected behaviour in our program.
- debugging is about identifying, finding , fixing and preventing bugs
- debugging process first try to identify during development by running automated tests or the worst kind of bugs is identified through user reports during production also identify the context where the bug is happening whether in a specific browser or with specific users..etc
- go to code and find the bug in the code using developer console or debugger software
- fix
- prevent by searching same bug in similar code also writing tests using test softwares

## Lecture no.61 Address: Debugging with the Console and Breakpoints

### Type: Code

- watch video in case of refresher and check code in final folder
  -console.log,console.warn,console.error are the same function of printing the input on the console only with different formatting. console.table(objectName) shows the object in a nicely formatted tabel.
- At 7:20 we will learn how to use a debugger in google chrome.
- set breakpoints in sources tab in beside the console tab in developer tool in chrome by clicking the left bar on a specific line of code that will give us red point. When we reload and play button is hit execution stops at this break point.
- you can continue execution by hitting stop button here.
- clear the red point to prevent stopping the code at this breakpoint.

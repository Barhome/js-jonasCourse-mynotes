- split the script.js as code starts from the bottom of the scripts and it depends on an object at the top of the script

## Lecture no.112 Address: Enhanced Object Literals

### Type: Code

- Check the object code in the top of the file to see all these things
- an object is called object literal when we basically write it literally in our code using the curly braces syntax.
- Es 6 introduced 3 ways to easily write an object literal like restaurant object in our code:
  1. no need to assign an object inside the object litteral if the property name is same as the object name like openingHours property
  2. when it comes to declaring a method inside of the object you can remove the semi colon : and function keyword.
  3. we can compute the property names if we want instead of writing them manually with the use of square brackets we can write inside of it any expression to compute the property name ex: [exp to compute the propertynam]: property value,

### Type: Theory

- Theory pdf pages 118-120
- we have 4 built in data structures in JS we will talk about the pros and cons of each data structure to help you when to choose one of them
- getting data from a web apis comes as a json which is just text or long string but we can easily converted into a javaScript object because the original text uses the same js objects formatting as js objects and arrays

## Lecture no.121 Address: Working With Strings - Part 1

### Type: Code

- Why strings have methods as they are primitive data types not object data types? The answer is whenever we call a method on a string JS will automatically behind the scenes will convert that string primitive to a string object with the same content and then on that object the method will be called.
- This process is called boxing because it takes the string and puts it in a box which is the object.

## Lecture no.143 Address: The new at Method

### Type: Code

- check the code examples in final folder, notes on code

## Lecture no.144 Address: Looping Arrays: forEach

### Type: Code

- check the code examples in final folder, notes on code

## Lecture no.145 Address: forEach With Maps and Sets

### Type: Code

- check the code examples in final folder, notes on code

## Lecture no.146 Address: PROJECT: "Bankist" App

### Type: Code

- Check the video as it talks about the project and flow chart in final folder
- later we will learn about how to create a flow chart

## Lecture no.147 Address: Creating DOM Elements

### Type: Code

- We will use some of DOM Manipulation techniques and learn about new ones.
- check the video to learn more
- used innerHTML='' to reset the html movement container and used insertAdjacentHTML to add elements with data from the account1 object in the html movement container.

## Lecture no.149 Address: Data Transformations: map,filter , reduce

### Type: Theory

- Theory pdf pages 134-136
- map, filter, reduce is like forEach method in concept
- map does an operation to all elements and returns a new array with the new results.
- filter it requires a test condition and it returns a new array with the elements passed this condition
- reduce boils down all array elements down to one single value, you need to specify the operation and accumulator variable for example addition to add all elements to the accumulator. and it returns the final accumulated value.

## Lecture no.150 Address: The map Method

### Type: Code

- check the code examples in final folder, notes on code

## Lecture no.151 Address: Computing Usernames

### Type: Code

- check the video to see the code examples on map and forEach methods

## Lecture no.152 Address: The filter Method

### Type: Code

- check the code examples in final folder, notes on code

## Lecture no.153 Address: The reduce Method

### Type: Code

- check the code examples in final folder, notes on code

## Lecture no.155 Address: The Magic of Chaining Methods

### Type: Code

- check the video and the code examples in final folder, notes on code
- Never over use chaining as chaining many methods can cause performance issues if we have huge arrays
- it is bad practice to chain method that mutate the original array like splice method or reverse method

## Lecture no.157 Address: The find Method

### Type: Code

- check the code examples in final folder, notes on code

## Lecture no.158 Address: Implementing login

### Type: Code

- check the video to see project logic where previous skills is implemented
- as clicking a form button reloads the page we need to prevent that by passing event object to the callback function in the addEventListent and add event.preventDefault() to prevent form from resubmitting
- hitting enter keyboard inside an input in a form triggers the click event.

## Lecture no.159 Address: Implementing Transfers

### Type: Code

- check the video to see project logic where previous skills is implemented

## Lecture no.160 Address: The findIndex Method

### Type: Code

- check the video and the note about findIndex in final folder, notes in code

## Lecture no.161 Address: some and every method

### Type: Code

- check the code examples in final folder, notes in code

## Lecture no.162 Address: flat and flatMap

### Type: Code

- revise the video to get more understanding

## Lecture no.164 Address: More Ways of Creating and Filling Arrays

### Type: Code

- check the code examples in final folder, notes in code

## Lecture no.165 Address: Summary: Which Array Method to Use?

### Type: Theory

- Theory pdf pages 137-139

## Lecture no.166 Address: Array Methods Practice

### Type: Code

- you didn't finish that , practice what you learned
